This sample script and Dockerfile are used to create an Azure Container Instance and then Azure Container Service with Kubernetes (AKS) cluster. The Dockerfile builds a container image with a basic NGINX instance.

The AKS cluster is then exposed for public access with a load balancer, the number of nodes is scaled up, and then the number of replicas in the deployment is scaled up.
